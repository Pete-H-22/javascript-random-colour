# javascript-random-colour
Script for generating random colours from the full RGB range.

The JS code snippet can be pasted into an HTML doc inside <script> tags. The code here generates the opening tag for a <div> element whose background colour changes randomly with each page load or refresh. A closing </div> tag should be added to your HTML doc in the appropriate location.
